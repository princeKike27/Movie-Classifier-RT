# Movie-Classifier-RT

For this project I analyzed data from movies in Rotten Tomatoes. Rotten Tomatoes is one of the leading recommendation resources for finding reviews of movies and TV shows. They use a Tomatometer score based on the opinions of hundreds of films and television critics to determine if a movie is Fresh. In that sense, using KNN algorithm I created a movie classifier that based on features like the movie's runtime, its year and its genre will predict if I will like the movie and it will reccomend me other similar movies to watch.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

- Data cleaning and standardization.
- Analysis of Relevant features to build the model.
- KNN Model for movie prediction and recommendation.
